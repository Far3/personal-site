## Personal site for Franklyn Roth

Built from the starter theme for Gridsome. Based off of [https://github.com/drehimself/gridsome-portfolio-starter.git](https://github.com/drehimself/gridsome-portfolio-starter.git`). A place to showcase my site to future collaborators and companies I'd like to work with.
