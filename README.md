## Personal site for Franklyn Roth

Built from the starter theme for Gridsome. Based off of [https://github.com/drehimself/gridsome-portfolio-starter.git](https://github.com/drehimself/gridsome-portfolio-starter.git`). A place to showcase my site to future collaborators and companies I'd like to work with.

## Development

1. `npm install`
1. `gridsome develop` to start a local dev server at `http://localhost:8080`

## TODO
- ~~Find Gridsome template~~
- ~~Deploy on netlify~~
- ~~Update projects copy~~
- ~~Migrate blog posts to new site~~
- ~~Set dark mode as default~~
