It makes more sense to charge a fixed fee that represents the value of the impact your work has on the clients instead of the hourly rate.

They don't hire to design a website, they hire to get a website thats going to help them grow their business.

Selling a solution that is going to make an impact for the client and get a business objective of theirs checked off.

Hourly billing, the client doesn't know what they are getting and what the final cost would be. Also the faster your work, the less money you get..it benefits yoy to drag your feet.

Value based pricing gives your business a margin of error during slow periods.

WHen you start off talking about price with a client, you're putting your needs ahead of theirs.

They don't want a website, they want revenue. WHen you talk about price before exploring even what your client is trying to achieve, you risk delivering a solution that isn't right for them.

* If a client wants to talk about price right away.
- Tell them you need to understand what they want first before I can set a price.
- Desperate to know a ballpark, give them a range.
- Clients that focus on price aren't the best type of clients anywway.


Instead
* Probe on what their dreams are, thei big goals.
Ideally client can express what they're trying to achieve in a dollar figure, like revenue or cost savings.


"I just want a website"
- Ask, "How much is a client worth to you?"
- What does success look like to you?


** What if a client can't put any value on your services.
- If that is the case, there is not much reason for us to pursue a working relationship.

I will go away and workup a proposal. It outlines the scope of the project and includes some options, each with its own value and price.


** Seven mutual benefits of exploring value with your clients.
1. Creates trust - Start off with probing questions, interested in understandingt their unique problems and crafting solutions.

2. Fosters alignment - During exploratoy phase, trying tofoster agreement between two points.
Probe on whata problems or pain the client might be experiencing. Sales might be trending downward or new competitors might be emerging.

Then ask about goals, business goals of the client.
Goals themselves create problems because if they are not met then the client will experience a loss.

Point A) Current pain points
Point B) Future pain points by missed goals.

3. Helps your client better evaluate vendors

The deciding factor becomes who can deliver value rather than price. Not many people help clients gain clarity, it leads to a leg up in the competition.

When you present prices up front, you make price your distinguishing factor, not the ability to deliver results.

Apples to apples
vs
apples to oranges

Low prices can create the perception of low values.
If someone is selling you a nice car for $1k, you know something is funky under the hood.

4. Frames the solution as an investment, not an expense.

Frame the price differently and tie it to value. Clients just want to know that the investment is a wise one.

5. Inspires action
Clients become quivker to act, because the conversation is an emotional one than a website for $2500 one.

6. Lets your client make an informed business decission.

Present the proposal as a menu. Options that have distinct prices.
Offer solutions at various depths that would help their business.

Don't haggle on price, if a client wants to pay less, they have to choose to have less delivered. They will put them in the driver seat where they can make an informed decision. WHere THEY are clear about the trade offs.

7. Establishes a trusted partnership

Inside Out

Clothing store upgrade example.
"We think it looks outdated"
steer convo to business objectives. Express some clear goals, not for the website, but the company in general.

Client reveals revenue targets, missing those targets would be a problem.

The fee usually range from 10 to 20 percent of the expected value. Ex, Build a 20k site that brings in 200k. 10k site that brings in 100k.

Other 2 options are extras.
Daily reports to help the client make timely business decisions.
Have monthly reporting, analytics, hosting, backups etc.
SERP profiles.

THinking about her clients and their problems, not just how much time she spent walking.

Eventually find the top paying clients that know the value and appreciate the value of services because it will be an investment vs and expense.

Look for new ways to add value if things are ery competivive instead of just competing on price, which just reduces you to a commodity.
